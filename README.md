# Mask-to-json-to-mask

If you are developing a segmentation model, you may need to convert your tags from json format to mask format.
Thanks to the interface we have developed, you will be able to easily turn your labels into masks.
Also, if you have masks and want to convert them to json format, you can easily do this with our application.
This conversion comes to you in Mask R-CNN format, so if you have mask photos, you can easily convert them to .json files suitable for Mask R-CNN format.
This convenience will allow you to convert the labels you have as you wish, even if they do not fit your format.

## How to Run
